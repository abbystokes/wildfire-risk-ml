Files in this repository and their contents:

data_exploration.ipynb   ---    Notebook which does some initial data exploration primarily using the FireScar_CL_Summary_1985-2018.xlsx file. Looks general information such as number of fires per year, month, and region, spatial distribution of fires by year for the region of Maule, and some initial geospatial statistical tests such as Ripley's K and KDE plots / correlation maps.

fire_viewer.ipynb   ---   Widget to visualize fire burn scar data for Maule. Visualizes burn scar vector, NBR, and severity map, as well as pre- and post-fire images with burn scar boundary overlay

File_Description.txt   ---   A text file which was downloaded from the PANGEA site which described the columns and files contained in the fire scar database.

classification_example.ipynb   ---   A notebook which contains an example of supervised learning classification of land cover using GEE functionalities.
